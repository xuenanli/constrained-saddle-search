This repository contains our code of using a constrained saddle search approach to construct singular and flexible bar frameworks.

To run the code, please open the driver_saddle_search.m and read the initial condition from "heptagon-initial-xx.mat" file. We provide 6 heptagon examples, with initial non-singular structures and the final singular and flexible structures. For each initial condition in "heptagon-initial-xx.mat", one can obtain a final state "heptagon-final-xx.mat".

Each final state in "heptagon-final-xx.mat" is singular and flexible with two branches of non-trivial nonlinear flexes. The two nonlinear flexes from the singular structure in "heptagon-final-xx.mat" are plotted in the animation "branch-2-heptagon-xx.mp4" and "branch-4-heptagon-xx.mp4".
